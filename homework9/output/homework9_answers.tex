\begin{enumerate}
    \item See \ref{fig:hw9q1}.  It appears that when I wrote the simulation that I accidentally included a common shock for year 3, but even though the graph is unrealistic, we can see the rollout of the second set of treatments.
    \item See column 1 of table \ref{tab:didtable}.
    \item See column 2 of table \ref{tab:didtable}.  Note the estimates did not change, but the standard errors did change due to clustering two way.s
    \item Now, there is no ``clean control'' or never-treated group.  The TWFE estimator will give the weighted average of all the possible DIDs.
    \item The command reports that out of 924 ATTs, 600 receive a positive weight and 324 receive a negative weight.
    \item See column 3 of table \ref{tab:didtable}.  It turns out that the command is not written in a standard way so that you can use \verb!outreg2! to easily store the results.  Instead, I wrote a program around the command that would output the results into Stata's e-class.  Finally, I used \verb!esttab! instead of \verb!outreg2! to create the tables.  See the code.
    \item Now, all 324 weights are positive.  This is because dropping the last month leaves us in a ``standard'' DID setting where there is only one treatment time.
